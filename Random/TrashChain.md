It seems that my problems with hashing just keep multiplying...<br>

### Approach
On going through the code, it can be realised that this is a sort of block chain cipher, in which the ciphertext of the previous block is affecting the plaintext of the present block while the hashing takes place.
###### Key Points :
- Integers must be greater than 1."
- Chain 2 must be at least 3 integers longer than chain 1")
- All integers in chain 1 must be less than the smallest element in chain 2

So for our convenience, let's consider the no. of elements in `Chain 1` to be 1 and in `Chain 2` to be 4.

###### How it works(say, for chain2):
c1 = 1 * ((chain2[0] + 1) ** B) % A<br>
c2 = c1 * ((chain2[1] + 2) ** B) % A<br>
c3 = c2 * ((chain2[2] + 3) ** B) % A<br>
hashes[1] = c3 * ((chain2[3] + 4) ** B) % A<br>

If somehow we can bring the value of `((chain2[i] + (i + 1)) ** B) % A` down to 1 at every step, we can obtain the values of c1, c2 and c3 to be 1 and therefore the final hash can be predictable.

Now there's a property of `modulus`, <br>
if a % b = c, then (a ** n ) % b = (c ** n) % b <br>
or in other words, ((n * a + 1) ** b) % a is always 1

Therefore we take the array as:<br>
`chain1 = [A - 1]` <br>
`chain2 = [2A, 2A - 1, 2A - 2, 2A - 4]`<br>
So that `hashes[0] = hashes[1] = 0`

Welcome to TrashChain!
In this challenge, you will enter two sequences of integers which are used to compute two hashes. If the two hashes match, you get the flag!
Restrictions:
  - Integers must be greater than 1.
  - Chain 2 must be at least 3 integers longer than chain 1
  - All integers in chain 1 must be less than the smallest element in chain 2
Type "done" when you are finished inputting numbers for each chain.

Provide inputs for chain 1.
> 340282366920938460843936948965011886880
> done

Provide inputs for chain 2.
> 680564733841876921687873897930023773762

> done
Hash for chain 1: 00000000000000000000000000000000
Hash for chain 2: 00000000000000000000000000000000
Correct! Here's your flag: DawgCTF{We1rd_RSA_2nd_Pre1m4g3_th1ng}
```
The flag is `DawgCTF{We1rd_RSA_2nd_Pre1m4g3_th1ng}`
